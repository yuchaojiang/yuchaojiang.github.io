###  Li's Biography

I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in Harrison School of Pharmacy at Auburn University. I am a member of 
The Omics and Informatics Cluster Hire in Auburn University. I received a BS from China majoring in Bioinformatics in 2009; a
MHS in [Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/index.html) in 2011, from the
Johns Hopkins University; another MSE in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) in 2011, from the
Johns Hopkins University. I joined the department right after obtaining my PhD in [Computer Science and Informatics](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/site/home/) at Emory University in 2017.
I also interned in CareerBuilder Data Science and Amazon Machine Learning in Summer 2014 and 2015 respectively.

### Research
I mainly work on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. To be specific, my research focuses on the development of statistical and informatics methods for the analysis of high-throughput genetic, genomic and other omics data. 
Specific topics include: integrative analysis of next generation sequencing and GWAS array data; 
integrative analysis of multi-omics data, e.g. 1000 Genomes, Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects; 
analysis of genome-wide DNA modification data e.g. MeDIP-seq, hME-Seal, BS-seq, TAB-seq; analysis of 16S rRNA based metagenomic data.
All methods developed have been implemented and released as free, open source software.
