###  Background

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Genomics and Computational Biology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 working with Dr. Nancy R. Zhang (advisor) and Dr. Mingyao Li. I obtained my M.A. in Statistics from the University of Pennsylvania in 2014 and my B.S. from Cornell University in 2012. I started as an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Genetics at UNC Chapel Hill in July 2017.


### Research

The Jiang Labâ€™s primary research interests lie in statistical modeling, method development and data analysis in genetics and genomics. Our current research is focused on developing statistical methods and computational algorithms to better utilize and analyze different types of next-generation sequencing data under various setting, with application to data from large-scale cohort studies of human health and disease. Special focus is on single-cell transcriptomics, single-cell epigenomics, cancer genomics, tumor phylogeny, data normalization, and copy number variation detection.
