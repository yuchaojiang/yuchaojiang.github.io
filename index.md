I obtained my Ph.D. in Genomics and Computational Biology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 working with [Dr. Nancy R. Zhang](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/nzh/) (advisor) and [Dr. Mingyao Li](http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8122973). I obtained my M.A. in Statistics from the University of Pennsylvania in 2014 and my B.S. from Cornell University in 2012 working with Dr. [Thomas D. Fox](https://mbg.cornell.edu/people/thomas-fox/). I started as a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Genetics at UNC Chapel Hill in 2017.

### Research

The Jiang Labâ€™s primary research interests lie in statistical modeling and method development in genetics and genomics, with application to data from large-scale cohort studies of human health and disease. We collaborate with biologists and clinicians to address statistical and computational challenges presented by new cutting-edge technologies and provide data-driven statistical methods to biomedical researchers for better data analysis and experimental design. Our special focus is on detecting structural variants, assessing intratumor heterogeneity, interrogating genome-wide DNA damage and repair, and deciphering cellular heterogeneity by single-cell omics approaches.
